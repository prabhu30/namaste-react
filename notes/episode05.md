## Types of Import & Export

- There are two types of import and export

  - Default
  - Named

- Default :- These can be used when you want to export/import just one entity

  ```
  export default Profile;

  import Profile from './components/Profile.js';
  ```

- Named :- These can be used when you want to export/import multiple entities from a file

  ```
  export const LOGO_URL;
  export let LaptopsList;

  import { LOGO_URL, LaptopsList } from './utils/constants.js';
  ```

## React Hooks ðŸš€

- A React Hook is just a **normal javascript utility function**, the only difference is that function has some logic written behind the scenes inside react
- Some of important react hooks are
  - `useState()`
  - `useEffect()`

## useState

- `useState` hook gives us two things -
  - a `state variable` , which can be used to manage state of our application
  - a function `setStateVariable` to update the value of the state variable
  - **IMPORTANT :** Whenever a state variable is updated, react re-renders the component(s) which are using / dependent upon that state variable.

## Virtual DOM

- Virtual DOM is a representation of the Actual DOM
- It is nothing but a kind of javascript object

## Diffing Algorithm

-

## Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)

- This has been introduced in React 16
- This algorithm is used to update the DOM whenever something changes
- Reconciliation is React's way of diffing / comparing the virtual DOM tree with the updated virtual DOM to determine the most efficient way to update the real DOM
