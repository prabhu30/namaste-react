## Higher Order Components

- It is a normal javascript function, which takes a component, enhances / modifies the component and returns a component
- Image you want to perform an action on only few sub-components in your main component (may be adding a promoted label, may be displaying them is a different color, etc.). In this case, you can pass props to your sub-component and based on the props received, you can perform some action in sub-component (Refer **RestaurantCard.js** in this repo for more details)
